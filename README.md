# Breast-Cancer-Classifier

The objective of this project is to apply fundamental machine learning concepts to a dataset from Scikit-learn, focusing on predictive modeling and analysis. The analysis involves data exploration, identifying the problem, and constructing a robust solution. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NumPy, I performed data visualization to derive insights and identify trends. The primary goal is to build an SVM classification model to predict whether breast tissue is malignant or benign, ensuring accuracy and interpretability through rigorous evaluation and justification of the results.
